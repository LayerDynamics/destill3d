# Destill3D

a tool that downloads objects from various 3d model hosting platforms, gathers all info needed and makes snapshots in extremely condensed format as copies of the objects, as well as all identifiable meta data and data from the models themselves and then classifies them and removes the original copy of the downloaded objects leaving only the needed data for classification, it in turn is creating the data needed to classify and understand any 3D objects.
